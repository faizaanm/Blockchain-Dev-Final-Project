1. How is web3 used in componentDidMount? How does the user connect to the blockchain network? This is metamask!

In componentDidMount, the function initializes an instance of web3 and gets the user account through a web3 wallet,
in this case metamask. The function then gets the smart contract ID and deploys it onto the web3 network which was 
previously initialized, simultaneously connecting the smart contract to the user's web wallet.

2. pick one function: fetchLoot, addLoot, or buyLoot and explain in detail what it is doing and how it works. Every line please!

fetchLoot function:
Line 58: Creates constant variables to input data from our smart contract.
Line 59: Sets React state for the component as initializing.
Line 61: Creates constant variable numTokens which calls the total supply of tokens in contract.
Line 62-63: Creates 2 lists; one of available tokens, and one of owned tokens.
Line 64: Create a for loop which iterates through each token in tokenList.
Line 65-67: Creates 3 constant variables which get token object, along with owner info.
Line 68-76: Takes data from token object and creates a dictionary of data for one token in tokenList.
Line 77: If statement which checks if the token is owned by a user already, adds it to owned token list.
Line 78: If statement which checks if the token is considered for sale, if so, then add to available token list.
Line 80: Sets React state for the component which sets initializing to false and returns available and owned token lists back.
